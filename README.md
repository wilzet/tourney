# Tourney
A program that runs a game tournament in parallell.

# The Game
The game being played will be a very 'game-theory' game similar to the [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma); simple and only contain a few rules and possible options for each participant. Whether or not the game will be 'perfect knowledge' is not decided.
## Rules
TBD
