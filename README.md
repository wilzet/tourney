# Tourney
A program that runs a game tournament in parallel.

# The Game
The game being played is a 'game-theory' game similar to the [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma); simple and only contains a few rules and possible options for each participant.
## Rules
The game is played in a non-deterministic amount of rounds. A round, or a move, consists of each player choosing a color. Each player has full knowledge of all moves that has been played this game.
1. There are three possible color options:<br>
  ðŸ”´ Red<br>
  ðŸŸ¢ Green<br>
  ðŸ”µ Blue
2. Scores are calculated after each move according to the following matrix:
  <div align="center">
    
  | 1 \\ 2    | **Red** | **Green** | **Blue** |
  | :-------: | :-----: | :-------: | :------: |
  | **Red**   | 1, 1    | 3, 0      | 1, -1    |
  | **Green** | 0, 3    | 2, 2      | 1, -1    |
  | **Blue**  | -1, 1   | -1, 1     | 0, 0     |
  </div>
  
  * Notice that the upper left 2x2 matrix corresponds to the prisoner's dilemma.
  * Also notice that choosing blue essentially equals giving your opponent one of your own points.
3. At the end of all rounds, the player that has played the most blue color options gets their score multiplied by 2.

The player with the highest score is deemed the winner. In the case of equal scores, it's a draw.

# Tournament
In its current state, the tournament has all participating programs playing against eachother for one game each. At the end of the tournament programs are listed in descending order according to their average score across their games.

## Example
```console
cargo run -- --min 100 --max 200 --games --threads 10
```
